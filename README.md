### üèÜ AI & Robotics Engineer | 3x Open Robotics World Champion üèÜ

I'm a passionate AI and Robotics Engineer with a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, dedicated to building intelligent, autonomous systems. My journey in programming began in **2008** with **VB**, leading me to a deep dive into **C++** and **C#** from **2010 to 2015** while working on robotics at the **Syntec Research Center**. Since **2019**, I've specialized in **Python**, focusing on cutting-edge AI frameworks and applying them to real-world problems. I've also been proficient with **Linux** environments since **2018**.

My academic work includes a Master's thesis focused on **Time Series Forecasting using Transformer algorithms**, where I achieved strong results by comparing them against other advanced models like **LSTM** and **GRU**. Beyond that, I've engaged in diverse projects spanning **Pattern Recognition**, **Information Hiding**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. I also gained exposure to the fascinating field of **Quantum Computing** during my university studies.

My career highlights include securing **three first-place victories** at the prestigious **Open Robotics World Championships**, a testament to my practical skills in developing and deploying advanced robotic solutions. Since **2021**, I've been actively contributing to innovative AI projects at the **Sunair Research Center**.

I thrive on transforming complex challenges into elegant, functional software solutions, constantly exploring the intersection of robotics, machine learning, and efficient system design.
